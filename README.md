✅ 1. GitHub Repo Setup
Here’s your ideal folder structure:
AgentTX-Harshu-Chatbot/
│
├── main.py                  # Entry point for chatbot logic
├── agents/
│   ├── greeting_agent.py    # Handles greetings
│   ├── faq_agent.py         # Answers common questions
│   └── fallback_agent.py    # Default response handler
├── streamlit_app.py         # UI layer for chatbot
├── config/
│   └── intents.json         # Intent definitions and routing map
├── assets/
│   └── screenshots/         # UI screenshots or diagrams
├── README.md                # Project overview and instructions
├── requirements.txt         # Dependencies
└── .gitignore               # Ignore cache, env files, etc.



🎨 2. Streamlit UI (streamlit_app.py)
Here’s a simple UI to get you started:
import streamlit as st
from main import route_message

st.set_page_config(page_title="AgentTX Harshu Chatbot", page_icon="🤖")

st.title("🤖 AgentTX Harshu Mini Chatbot")
user_input = st.text_input("You:", "")

if user_input:
    response = route_message(user_input)
    st.markdown(f"**Harshu:** {response}")


Make sure route_message() is your main routing function in main.py.

📸 3. Visuals for GitHub
